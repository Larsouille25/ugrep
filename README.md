# ugrep
A micro grep-like command line, in Rust but in very lightweight version. The pronunciation of ugrep is "micro grep" because the u is actually a Âµ (micro).

## Use
`ugrep <PATTERN> <PATH>`
Where the pattern is what you want to search and the path is an absolute / relative path to a file.

There is also the `-c` flag, is for case sensitive research and the `-o` flag to print only the result.
